<p class="chapter-heading">Hello and welcome to my homepage!</p>

<p>
  Welcome to my small personal spot on the internet.
  This is the place where I put all the things which I think are useful.
  So you'll find information about me, what I do, and things I learned.
  As information is most useful when it is shared, I want to share it in a way,
  that is most useful to everyone.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to know how you can share your works in ways that help the public the most,
  please check out the page about <a class="clickable" onclick="clickNavItem('copyright')">copyright and copyleft</a>.
