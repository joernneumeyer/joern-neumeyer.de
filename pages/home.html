<p class="chapter-heading">Hello and welcome to my homepage!</p>

<p>
  Welcome to my small personal spot on the internet.
  This is the place where I put all the things which I think are useful.
  So you'll find information about me, what I do, and things that I learned.
  As information is most useful when it is shared, I want to share it in a way,
  that is most useful to everyone.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to know how you can share your works in ways that help the public the most,
  please check out the sub-page about <a class="clickable" onclick="clickNavItem('copyright')">copyright</a>.

<p class="chapter-heading">About me, J&ouml;rn Neumeyer...</p>
<p class="section-heading">...in general</p>
<p class="section-heading">...as a person</p>
<p>
  I have always been interested in technology.
  This interest originated from the influence of my father
  and his job as an industrial grinding machine technician.
  But my interest in IT and especially programming only started in the last
  year of middleschool.
  Back then, I was playing an online multiplayer game, which required you to
  either cheat or invest a significant amount of money.
  Since I have not been willing to pay money for that game, I went for the cheaating path.
</p>
<p>
  As time went on, more and more of these cheats got depected.
  So far so normal.
  But at some point, the anti-cheat of the game producer would not just detect
  the cheats but also the DLL injectors used to load the cheats into the game's process.
  That was a huge issue. So, I searched the internet to find ways of creating my own DLL injector.
