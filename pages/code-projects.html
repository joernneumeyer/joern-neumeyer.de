<span class="justify-text">
  I try to be as active as possible in the development of Free Software.
  So, one of the things i do is the development of software libraries and frameworks.
  Below, you'll find a listing of the software which I developed, that may be used for educational
  purposes as well as further software development of course.

      <td>SocialStuff</td>
      <td>
        SocialStuff is a prototype for an end-to-end encrypted, decentralized communication network.
        Its goal is to increase the soverignty of individuals and groups and make their communication secure and censorship resistent.
        <strong>IMPORTANT!</strong>
        Since this is just a prototype, using it with the intention of having properly secured communication channel is highly discouraged!
        An improved version is currently in the making, but it will take some time for it to be finished.
        Until then, please look for other alternatives.

      <td>TinyScript</td>
      <td>
        TinyScript is my first (kind of) successful take on creating my own programming/scripting language.
        As the name already suggests, the feature set is very limited.
        Natively, only basic arithmetic operations and functions are supported.
        However, it is easily extendible by adding some annotated Java classes, which TinyScript can bridge into.

      <td>pipe7</td>
      <td>
        pipe7 is a PHP library for data processing. It focused on (and optimized for) memory efficiency.
        It aims to be an alternative to PHP's native array functions (like array_map) and provide a consistent API.
        In addition to the native functionality, pipe7 also allows you to process iterators without having to convert them to arrays first.

      <td>LibrePages</td>
      <td>
        LibrePages is a light PHP framework, which enables easy MVC-like development
        of REST APIs. It provides all basic blocks which are necessary: routing, request validation,
        middleware processing, and testing. Simplicity is one large goal of LibrePages, as it
        does not only enable applications to be developed easier, but it also illustrates, what components
        are key and build the core of basically any server side framework.
